# CDC Diabetes health indicators (Zdravstveni pokazatelji dijabetesa 1)

This seminar analyzes data gathered by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, conducting tests to ascertain whether or not any of the data correlates.

Written as part of the course `Multivarijantna i dubinska analiza podataka` (eng. `Multivariate and Deep Data Analysis`) at the `Faculty of Organization and Informatics`, Varaždin, this work is the result of the collaborative efforts of Joshua Lee Fletcher and Noa Midžić.
